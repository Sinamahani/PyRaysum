** Need to install FLIBS 'csv_file' module

The program 'seis-spread' is the main program that runs all the sub routines. 

1 - readmodel - in 'readwrite.f' (should be Python functions, similar to Telewavesim)
2 - buildmodel -  in 'buildmodel.f' (should be Python functions, similar to Telewavesim)
3 - readgeom - in 'readwrite.f'
4 - readparams - in 'seis-spread.f' (reads in parameters of traces or writes them to file if not found - should be Python functions)
5 - generate phse list (depends on )
