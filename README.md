## Software for modeling ray-theoretical body-wave propagation

This program generates sets of ray-theoretical seismograms for an
incident plane wave (teleseismic approximation) for models consisting
of a stack of layers with planar but nonparallel (dipping) interfaces,
allowing the possibility of anisotropy in the layers. Incident P and S
waves are supported.
