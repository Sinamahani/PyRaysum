Documentation
=============

``PyRaysum`` is a Python wrapper around the Fortran code Raysum, developed by Andrew Frederiksen in collaboration with Michael Bostock. Raysum is a software to model teleseismic body-wave scattering in the presence of layer dip and/or anisotropy. ``PyRaysum`` includes the original Fortran software and provides a script to compile and install Raysum, and functions to interact with the software. Common computational workflows are covered in the ``Jupyter`` notebooks bundled with this package.
